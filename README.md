# Diabetes-Project
In this project, the prediction is made whether the person is going to be diabetic, non-diabetic or pre-diabetic. Various models are deployed to check which model gives the best performance for the datasets. It uses various health indicators to check if the person has the disease or not.
Data Analysis is done by using the indicators such as glucose levels, BMI, insulin, age, and more.
Machine learning was done using various models such as KNeighborsClassifier, GaussianNB, SVC, RandomForestClassifier, DecisionTreeRegressor, XGBClassifier.
The performance of the models was evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F-1 Score.
